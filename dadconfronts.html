    <p>Your father toils on and on while you waste your life wallowing in self
      pity and letting your student loans accumulate interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, one day your father's patience runs out and he brings up the
      topic of your choice of getting a business major with a liberal arts
      minor at a state college. "Son, in life, if we want things, we must
      take them for ourselves," he groans. "The reason why I supported you
      through that stupid choice of a college major was because I had faith
      that through difficulty, you would grow. You would learn to sieze the
      day and learn to recognize and take advantage of opportunities in front
      of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But dad, there are no opportunities," you whine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not, son. Opportunities only surface if you go and look for
      them. Nothing will find its way to you through a Reddit post or a meme,"
      your father retorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few seconds of silence, your father offers a minimum wage trainee
      position at a local factory. What do you do?
