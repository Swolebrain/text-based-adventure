    <p>You finally learn that what is best in life. You realize that happiness
      can only be obtained from achievement, and you're giving yourself plenty
      to achieve every day. It's been a year since you last felt sorry
      for yourself and you've developed websites for over ten non-profits and
      even a couple of paying clients.
    </p>
    <p>With your newly developed portfolio of works, finding work is all
    but inevitable. In fact, your demonstrable hard skill in web development
    makes you an asset to many companies.</p>
    <p>Over the next few years, you work your way up to the job of your
    dreams and end up making $100k on a job where you make your own hours.</p>
    <p>You marry the spouse of your dreams and live happily ever after.</p>
