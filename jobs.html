    <p>You go on every job board and apply to what feels like hundreds of jobs,
      but is actually just a couple of dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your sense of worth walks the edge of a knife, but you refuse to quit.
      You continue frantically applying to jobs, all day every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon enough, you start finding a reward in the personal growth you
      are experiencing from continuing in this seemingly-futile struggle. You
      start learning about websites and making websites for your friends and
      family. At this point, your days are 12 hour shifts split between
      learning time and job applications with ever more elaborate cover letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rejection doesn't phase you any more at all. Your numerous job applications
      have resulted in your information ending up in the hands of a few
      stock brokerages and insurance companies that are offering you
      opportunities to sell for them on a commission-only basis.
